1.  Introduction

   This document describes how to use ML-DSA keys and signature as
   described in [FIPS-204] with [WebAuthn].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Some examples in this specification are truncated with "..." for
   readability.

3.  Background on Post-Quantum Cryptography

   This section describes a generic backround of Post-Quantum
   Cryptography, Web Authentication and Phishing Resistance.  Post-
   Quantum Cryptography is defined to be a set of cryptographic
   algorithms that are not vulnerable against a malicious actor in
   possession of a large scale Quantum Computer.  [FIPS-204] has
   described Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm which is
   not vulnerable to attacks involving a large-scale quantum computer.

3.1.  Motivation for ML-DSA in WebAuthn

   With the wide range adoption of phishing-resistant passwordless
   authentication standard like Security Keys, Passkeys and Device
   attestation following the FIDO2 Specifications, the adopted
   cryptographic standards for authentication have been primarily ES256
   (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm with SHA-256) and RS256
   (RSA with SHA-256) as defined in [FIPS-186-5].  Though most
   authenticators support other algorithms as well, the widely used
   default algorithms- ES256 and RS256 are deemed to be insecure against
   adversaries employing large-scale quantum computers.

   Hence, the adoption of ML-DSA for WebAuthn would be necessary to
   secure digital identities and accounts from such adversaries.

4.  ML-DSA Integration in WebAuthn

   This section describes the implementation of WebAuthn with ML-DSA.

4.1.  ML-DSA Key Representation in COSE

   [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-dilithium-05] describes CBOR Object Signing and
   Encryption (COSE) Serialization for ML-DSA.  It is to be noted that
   the COSE representation of only 'Public key' or 'Verifying key' is
   used in WebAuthn.  Hence, the COSE Representation of private keys are
   beyond the scope of this document.

   ML-DSA Signature Scheme is parameterized to support different
   security levels.  In this document, the abbreviations of ML-DSA-44,
   ML-DSA-65 and ML-DSA-87 are used to refer to ML-DSA with the
   parameter choices given in Table 1 of FIPS-204.

   This document requests the registration of the ML-DSA algorithms in
   [IANA.cose] as mentioned in [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-dilithium-05] as :

   +===========+=================+=========================+
   | Name      | value           | Description             |
   +===========+=================+=========================+
   | ML-DSA-44 | TBD (requested  | CBOR Object Signing     |
   |           | assignment -48) | Algorithm for ML-DSA-44 |
   +-----------+-----------------+-------------------------+
   | ML-DSA-65 | TBD (requested  | CBOR Object Signing     |
   |           | assignment -49) | Algorithm for ML-DSA-65 |
   +-----------+-----------------+-------------------------+
   | ML-DSA-87 | TBD (requested  | CBOR Object Signing     |
   |           | assignment -50) | Algorithm for ML-DSA-87 |
   +-----------+-----------------+-------------------------+

              Table 1: COSE algorithms for ML-DSA

   In accordance with the Algorithm Key Paid Type section of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-dilithium-05], when present in AKP Keys, the
   "pub" parameter has the following constraints:

   The "pub" parameter is the ML-DSA public key, as described in
   Section 5.3 of FIPS-204.

   The size of "pub", and the associated signature for each of these
   algorithms is defined in Table 2 of FIPS-204, and repeated here for
   convenience:

   +===========+=============+============+================+
   | Algorithm | Private Key | Public Key | Signature Size |
   +===========+=============+============+================+
   | ML-DSA-44 | 2560        | 1312       | 2420           |
   +-----------+-------------+------------+----------------+
   | ML-DSA-65 | 4032        | 1952       | 3309           |
   +-----------+-------------+------------+----------------+
   | ML-DSA-87 | 4896        | 2592       | 4627           |
   +-----------+-------------+------------+----------------+

      Table 2: Sizes (in bytes) of keys and signatures of
                             ML-DSA

   These algorithms are used to produce signatures as described in
   Algorithm 2 of FIPS-204.

   Signatures are encoded as bytestrings using the algorithms defined in
   Section 7.2 of FIPS-204.

4.2.  Signature Generation and Verification

   Signature generation is done in accordance with Section 5.2 of FIPS-
   204.  Signature Verification is done in accordance with Section 5.3
   of FIPS-204.

   If small keys or signature is needed, ML-DSA might not be the ideal
   option.  Furthermore, in usage scenarios expecting swifter
   processing, ML-DSA-87 might not be the best option.  Therefore, using
   ML-DSA-44 and ML-DSA-65 with WebAuthn is advised.

5.  Authenticator Behavior

   This section describes how an authenticator, roaming or platform
   would implement ML-DSA.

   The authenticator MUST have a secure storage for storing
   cryptographic secrets which SHOULD NOT be able to export the secrets
   in an unauthorized manner.

   [WebAuthn] defines the credential creation API.  This API takes a
   public key credential creation object, containing a cryptographic
   challenge, the Relying Party ID (RP ID), User details, and public key
   credential parameters.  The public key credential parameters define
   the accepted algorithms.

   An example of public key credential creation object is:

{
  challenge: new Uint8Array([215, 150, 119, 213, 215, 247, 188, 15, 142, 10, 53, 135, 17, 205, 130, 133, 158, 32, 113, 0, 62, 67, 112, 191, 123, 180, 224, 151, 233, 114, 68, 225]),
  rp: { id: "example.com", name: "Example Corporation" },
  user: {
    id: new Uint8Array([79, 252, 83, 72, 214, 7, 89, 26]),
    name: "johndoe",
    displayName: "John Doe",
  },
  pubKeyCredParams: [{ type: "public-key", alg: -7 }, { type: "public-key", alg: -49 }],
}

   The web application invokes the Navigator.credentials.create()
   function with the Public Key Credential Creation Object.  The client
   web browser, or an application invokes the authenticator API defined
   in [CTAP].  The public key credential creation object is CBOR encoded
   and sent to the authenticator device over a chosen transport method
   which includes but is not limited to USB HID, BLE and NFC.

   An example of CBOR Encoded Public Key Credential Creation object is:

h'A50158201637B26333915747DBDC6C630C0165405A64939AE8F6E4FC39414F853F702F1602A2626964696C6F63616C686F7374646E616D656B44656D6F2073657276657203A3626964504EC1D4219F294FB4A0BC0CD29D485AFC646E616D6566615F757365726B646973706C61794E616D6567412E20557365720481A263616C67382F64747970656A7075626C69632D6B657907A1627576F5'

   The authenticator MUST verify whether any credential mentioned in the
   list of "excludeCredentials" in the public key credential creation
   object is already present on the authenticator, and in such cases it
   will return the error code in accordance with [CTAP].  Further
   authenticator MUST perform all additional checks involving
   authenticator PIN, User presence, user verification etc in accordance
   with Section 5.1 of CTAP.

   The authenticator generates ML-DSA keypair in accordance with
   Section 5.1 of FIPS 204 and unique Key ID.  The public key is COSE
   encoded following [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-dilithium-05] and is a part of
   the attestedCredentialData.

   After passing all checks in accordance with section 5.1 of CTAP, the
   authenticator SHOULD create the attestation statement.  The authData
   is created in accordance with WebAuthn and CTAP specifications and
   the clientDataHash is appended to it.  This is signed with the
   private key of the generated keypair.  The attestation statement is
   generated in accordance with CTAP and WebAuthn.

   The ML-DSA private key is to be stored in accordance with the
   "Storage security and Key management" section of this document.

   The attestation statement is encoded in CBOR and returned to the
   client application via the same transport method.

   [WebAuthn] defines the credential request API.  This API takes a
   public key credential request object, containing a cryptographic
   challenge, the Relying Party ID (RP ID) and optionally a list of
   allowed credentials.

   An example of public key credential request object is:

{
  challenge: new Uint8Array([215, 150, 119, 213, 215, 247, 188, 15, 142, 10, 53, 135, 17, 205, 130, 133, 158, 32, 113, 0, 62, 67, 112, 191, 123, 180, 224, 151, 233, 114, 68, 225]),
  rpId: "example.com",
}

   The web application invokes the Navigator.credentials.get() function
   with the Public Key Credential Request Object.  The client web
   browser, or an application invokes the authenticator API defined in
   [CTAP].  The public key credential request object is CBOR encoded and
   sent to the authenticator device over a chosen transport method which
   includes but is not limited to USB HID, BLE and NFC.

   If a list of allowedCredentials is present, the authenticator must
   discover credentials bound to the same RP ID which is present in the
   list.  If no such credential is present, it will return the error
   code in accordance with [CTAP].  Further authenticator MUST perform
   all additional checks involving authenticator PIN, User presence,
   user verification etc in accordance with Section 5.2 of CTAP.

   The authenticator, on discovering a suitable credential for
   authentication SHOULD verify the algorithm.  If it is not ML-DSA, the
   authenticator SHALL behave in accordance with the "Backward
   Compatibility Considerations" section of this document.

   The credential is retrieved in accordance with the "Storage security
   and Key management" section of this document.

   After passing all checks in accordance with section 5.2 of CTAP, the
   authenticator SHOULD create the assertion statement.  The authData is
   created in accordance with WebAuthn and CTAP specifications and the
   clientDataHash is appended to it.  This is signed with the decrypted
   ML-DSA private key.  The assertion response is generated in
   accordance with CTAP and WebAuthn.

   The assertion response is encoded in CBOR and returned to the client
   application via the same transport method.

   All memory addresses used to handle the ML-DSA private key is
   immediately zeroized.

   The authenticator getNextAssertion() function specification is to be
   similarly implemented in accordance with [CTAP].

5.3.  Backward Compatibility Consideration

   The authenticator SHOULD choose the algorithm to be used in
   accordance with CTAP, and hence not choose ML-DSA if not supported by
   the RP.

6.  Client and Platform Considerations

   This section describes the considerations about the Client and
   Platform.

6.1.  COSE Algorithm Support in WebAuthn Clients

   The CTAP implementations on client, for example Windows Hello for
   Microsoft Windows based systems, iCloud Keychain for Apple systems,
   Google Password Manager, Dashlane, OnePassword and other browser
   based implementations for Linux SHOULD have support for ML-DSA
   Algorithms in accordance with COSE.  Further, Platform Authenticators
   for such devices are RECOMMENDED to have support for ML-DSA Key
   Generation and signing in accordance with this document.

6.2.  Handling large signatures and keys

   It is considered that the chosen transport methods including but not
   limited to USB HID, BLE and NFC are able to perform exchanges of the
   CBOR encoded data which may be often over 2000 bytes.  The use of
   attestion certificates may increase the length even more.

6.3.  Error Handling and Fallback mechanisms

   In case of errors involving ML-DSA key generation and signing, the
   authenticator may fallback to using ES256 or RS256 algoritms.  In
   case of errors involving communication with the client, the
   authenticator may handle it in accordance with [CTAP].

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC9053] applies to this
   specification as well.

   A detailed security analysis of ML-DSA is beyond the scope of this
   specification, see [FIPS-204] for additional details.

7.1.  Resistance to Quantum Attacks

   See [FIPS-204] for details on resistance to quantum attacks.

7.2.  Storage security and Key management

   It is to be noted that at the time of writing this draft, there is no
   suitable hardware security module (HSM), trusted platform module
   (TPM), Secure Element (SE), Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) with
   native support for ML-DSA.  Hence, secure credential storage is a
   challenge.  To overcome the same, the ML-DSA keys, also referred to
   as credentials, MUST be encrypted with Advanced Ecnryption Standard
   (AES), which is a Post Quantum Symmetric encryption algorithm in
   Galosis Counter Mode (GCM) with 256-bit keys.

   The AES Keys MUST be generated and stored in secure storage, which
   may include a HSM, TPM, SE or TEE.  The ML-DSA Keys may be generated
   on the standard computing environment, outside the secure storage.
   The ML-DSA Credential MUST be encrypted by AES as described above
   before being written to the Flash memory or Disk.  Conversely, the
   same MUST be decrypted by AES in the secure storage before being
   used.

   Any memory location, pointer or heap that has been used to handle the
   ML-DSA Credentials MUST be zeroized immediately after the operation
   is performed.

   This section is to be updated when suitable secure storage modules
   supporting ML-DSA becomes widely available.

7.3.  Implementation Best Practices

   If the amount of space in the secure storage permits, each ML-DSA
   Private key is RECOMMENDED to be encrypted with unique AES keys. *
   Prior to storage, each ML-DSA private key is to be encrypted
   independently using a distinct AES encryption key. * To guarantee
   robust encryption, the AES key size must be at least AES-256. * To
   avoid unwanted access, encrypted keys ought to be kept in Hardware
   Security Modules (HSMs), Secure Elements (SEs), or Trusted Platform
   Modules (TPMs). * NIST SP 800-57 recommendations should be followed
   by key management to provide secure AES key lifecycle management
   (creation, storage, rotation, and disposal). * Only in a trusted
   execution environment (TEE) or secure enclave should the private key
   be decrypted in order to avoid memory leakage.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Additions to Existing Registries

   This document requests the registration of the ML-DSA entries to the
   COSE Algorithm Registry as mentioned in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-cose-dilithium-05].
